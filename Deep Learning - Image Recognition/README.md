## Course Description
Thanks to deep learning, image recognition systems have improved and are now used for everything from searching photo libraries to generating text-based descriptions of photographs. In this course, learn how to build a deep neural network that can recognize objects in photographs. Find out how to adjust state-of-the-art deep neural networks to recognize new objects, without the need to retrain the network. Explore cloud-based image recognition APIs that you can use as an alternative to building your own systems. Learn the steps involved to start building and deploying your own image recognition system.
